Create a new project and call it Pr2. 
Your project shall have 
	3 classes, which are 
		Main, 
		Mammal, and 
		Canis.

The class 
	Canis shall have 
		data members 
		describing the animal. 
		For example a data member called 
			type (String) should receive 
				a value "Wolf". 
	The animal should have a 
		birth date, and 
		gender (male or female).

The class Mammal shall have 
	data members describing the type species. Therefore the class needs a data member called 
		specie (String) which in our case should hold 
			the value Canine. Mammals have a 
		life expectancy and it varies considerably between the difference species. You could include a data member called lifeExpectancy (int). Canines get about 12 years old. Some mammals can fly, you could have a variable that indicates it as a boolean Aerial. 

The class Canis shall 
	inherit from 
		class Mammal. Mammal is the 
		super class and 
	Canis is the 
		sub class. You only need to have 
	two or three data members per class.

Class Main shall 
	instantiate 
		one object of 
			type Canis and 
		display 
			the associated data to the console.

I am evaluating the project considering the object oriented concepts. Format the code. Put your name on each file. Only submit the *.java files.
